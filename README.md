Vector is a fundamental concept in Mathematics, Physics, and Engineering. With both magnitude and direction, vectors are identified with a tuple, or list of numbers. In this project, you are required to implement three primitive functions: vector addition (denoted A+B), vector subtraction (denoted A-B), and dot product (denoted A*B). There are two input vectors A and B. Each vector contains 8 integer elements separated by commas. The values of integer elements in A and B are between -9 and 9.




Please submit your source code according to the following rules:

<ul>

 <li>Write down enough comments such that you would receive higher scores.</li>

 <li>The filename is your student ID (e.g., B12345678.asm).</li>

</ul>




Example:

Please input vector A:

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 Please input vector B:

2,0,1,3,0,3,2,0

A+B = (3,2,4,7,5,9,9,8)

A-B = (-1,2,2,1,5,3,5,8)

A*B = 49
